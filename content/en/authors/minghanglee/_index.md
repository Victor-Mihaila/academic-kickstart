## Intro

Minghang Li is an undergraduate research intern. She is expected to receive Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences and Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) in August, 2022.

She has led the development of [Petasearch](https://github.com/steineggerlab/Petasearch), an algorithm for fast and approximate comparison of huge protein datasets since 2020, in collaboration with [Milot Mirdita](https://github.com/milot-mirdita) and [Jonas Hügel](https://github.com/JonasHuegel) from [Söding Lab](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/soeding). In the meantime, she is also the cluster DevOps of Steinegger's lab.

## Research Interest

Minghang is interested in developing high-performance software using algorithmic and architectural optimizations to analyze massive amounts of biological data, especially metagenomics data. She is also interested in distributed computing, cloud computing and database design, which are core technologies to enable more efficient storage and analysis of genomics data.
