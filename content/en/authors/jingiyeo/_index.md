### Intro
Jingi Yeo joined Steinegger Lab in Oct, 2022.
He is interested in leveraging computational tools to accelerate research to enable precise experiments.

He analyzed known proteins through predicted protein structures from the AlphaFold2 Database ([Barrio-Hernandez I. & Yeo J. et al., <i>Nature</i>, 2023.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06510-w)), and he is currently clustering the ESM Metagenomic Atlas database to explore metagenomic proteins in depth.
